# MACRO-ECONOMIC DASHBOARD
### The macroeconomic dashboard is a project for MINECOFIN/OCE designed to provide a quick visualization and interpretation of key macroeconomic indicators.
### Designed by Andrew Mushokambere and Evariste Manirumva, students from the AIMS Data Science Capacity Building Initiative (DSCBI) Program 
** This repository presents the dashboard project structure from data to notebooks/Scripts(code) folders. The structure is as follows. 1. Data folder consists of a macro-database, 2. Notebook folder consists of Python code scripts to process and clean database, and 3. src folder is for Java scripts to process data into the dashboard. 4. proenv folder is an environment file that houses all necessary packages and tools to configure the dashboard. 5. Docs folder contains ppt&doc documentations designed for presentation of the project. 

### Project access in GitHub
Project is housed in GitHub for easy collaboration among developers (using push&pull, branch features), easy sharing, and external access.

### Run dashboard
### 1.VS Code: terminal 
** Project is hosted by VS Code just for visualization and display of the dashboard structure
** VS Code can be used to run the dashboard app using VS Code terminal
#### command prompt (CMD) is preferable:
1. set the main project path as in local computer i.e., D:\Documents\AIMS_DSCBI\Projects\MINECOFIN\Macro_Dashboard. Therefore, you can access main folder structure as described earlier above
2. go to scripts folder i.e., D:\Documents\AIMS_DSCBI\Projects\MINECOFIN\Macro_Dashboard cd src:
3. then type ""
