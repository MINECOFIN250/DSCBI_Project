# \# MACRO-ECONOMIC DASHBOARD

# \### I. Project description

# Macro-economic dashboard is a project for MINECOFIN/OCE designed to provide a quick visualization and interpretation of key macroeconomic indicators.

# Designed by Andrew Mushokambere and Evariste Manirumva, students from the AIMS Data Science Capacity Building Initiative (DSCBI) Program

# \*\* This repository presents the dashboard project structure from data to notebooks/Scripts(code) folders.

# The structure is as follows.

# 1\. Data folder consists of a macro-database,

# 2\. Notebook folder consists of Python code scripts to process and clean database, and

# 3\. src folder contains main script files to process data into the dashboard.

# 4\. services: contains different .py files designed to perform various tasks to run dashboard\* functions assigned to those files include charts, prototype drop-downs, database loading, and metrics design

# 5\. static: folder contains folders incl. css (style.css for dash colors), images(dash header icons), JavaScripts for more interactivity of charts in dashboard)

# 6\. templates: contains HTML script to create a webpage template prototype dashboard

# 7\. proenv folder is an environment file that houses all necessary packages and tools to configure the dashboard.

# 8\. Docs folder contains project report, ppt\&doc documentations designed for presentation of the project.

# 9\. output contains dashboard products i.e., a video file that demonstrates a live illustration of the dashboard.

# 

# \### II. GitHub Repository

# project is housed in GitHub for easy collaboration among developers (using push\&pull, branch features), easy sharing, and external access.

# \#### III. Application or Product Link

# 

# \### Run dashboard

# \#### 1. VS Code: terminal

# \*\* Project is hosted by VS Code just for visualization and display of the dashboard structure

# \*\* VS Code can be used to run the dashboard app using VS Code terminal

# \#### 2. Command prompt (CMD):

# 1\. set the main project path as in local computer i.e., D:\\Documents\\AIMS\_DSCBI\\Projects\\MINECOFIN\\Macro\_Dashboard. Therefore, you can access main folder structure as described earlier above

# 2\. Go to src folder, i.e., D:\\Documents\\AIMS\_DSCBI\\Projects\\MINECOFIN\\Macro\_Dashboard cd src:

# 3\. then type "python app.py", find and click the link (dashboard URL) displayed in the results to get to the dashboard
